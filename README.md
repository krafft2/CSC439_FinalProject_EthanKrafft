# CSC439_FinalProject_EthanKrafft
This repository includes two programs and multiple data files used in a CSC 439 NLP course final project. 
It is based on a Naive-Bayes classification problem and utilizes increased amount of background coding rather than reliance on available NLP libraries. 

The repository contains three .txt files that are used for the train, devlopment, and testing datasets. They include a document/sentences
representing movie reviews with an associated binary sentiment class rating. (0: negative, 1: positive).

SentimentAnalysis.py is the main program that includes the calculations used to create a binary Naive-Bayes classification model.
SentimentTest.py is used to run, test, debug, and print results for SentimentAnalysis.py. 

This project is used in Dr. Jansen's CSC 439 NLP course as a final project.
